<h3>Kirtland's Warbler</h3>
<i>Dendroica kirtlandii</i>
<h4>U.S. Status: <span style="color:orange;">Near Threatened</span></h4>
<h4>Michigan Status: <span style="color:orange;">Recently Delisted from Endangered Species List</span></h4>
<p>
A warbler with a yellow breast, black side streaks, and distinctive white eye rings. Lives primarily in young Jack pine stands.
Species survival depends on small, geographically restricted, and very specific breeding zones within jack pine forests, and depends on disturbance by (historically) wildfire, which modern management techniques emulate the effects of. Human disturbance, habitat loss, and mismanagement of their breeding zones are its greatest threats. <a href="https://www.fws.gov/midwest/endangered/birds/Kirtland/index.html">Learn more about Kirtland's Warbler here.</a>
