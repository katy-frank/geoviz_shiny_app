<h3>Gray Wolf</h3>
<i>Canis lupus</i>
<h4>U.S. Status: <span style="color:red;">Endangered</span></h4>
<h4>Michigan Status: <span style="color:red;">Endangered</span></h4>
<p>
The largest of the wild dog species, usually with gray fur (but there is some variation in coat color). Found in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Has limited habitat requirements but prefers areas with low human disturbance and minimal infrastructure as it is wide-ranging. Also needs areas with an adequate amount of prey species, like the white-tailed deer and other mammals. Primary threats are from humans, who in the past hunted it nearly to extinction. <a href="https://www.fws.gov/midwest/wolf/">Learn more about the Gray Wolf here.</a>
